fetch, merge, and pull

git fetch and git merge origin/master will fetch & integrate remote changes. Let me explain a common scenario. origin/master is at C. Someone pushed D. You worked on E & F. Note that you will not see D in your local repository until you run git fetch.

   origin/master
    v
A-B-C-E-F < master
     \
     (D) < master on remote
Now you run git fetch. Now you can see D, and origin/master is updated to match the remote repository that it's tracking.

A-B-C-E-F < master
     \
      D < origin/master, master on remote
Now you run git merge, giving you this:

A-B-C-E-F
     \   \
      D---G < master
      ^
    origin/master, master on remote
So now you've integrated your changes on master (E, F) with the new commits on origin/master (D).

git pull is simply a shortcut for the above steps.
